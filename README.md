# batch_rip_to_smd
A simple Blender Python script to batch process NinjaRipper .RIP files to StudioMDL Data Format (.SMD). Requires Blender Source Tools. 

The txt file is the Python script that automates the conversion in Blender. 
It takes files in folders in another folder as the input. The middle folder must start with 2022. Then it adds each .RIP to the scene, exports as .SMD to the output folder.
